# Objektbaserad-programmering

This code is a console application in C++ language that reads data from a file named "names.txt" and allows the user to search for information within the data.

The program defines two structs, "Person" and "Address", to store data about people and their addresses.

The program reads the data from the file "names.txt" and stores it in a vector of Person objects.

The user is then given two options: to search for people by a part of their name, or to search for people in a specific city. The user can also choose to exit the program.
